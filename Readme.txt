In some of the older fighting games, you will find that the game will not teach you a lot of the buttons due to its basis on arcade game that didnâ€™t have it. You would just need to look on the cabinet and they would have a picture for it.
But if you play on pc, you might need to look it up and there are plenty of options for it. However, the websites are not built for team fighting games and only show the characters in order of the website builders' choice-making. You need to scroll to find the other team members or have multiple tabs.
My plan is to let you choose your team and display them in one area and give you their move sets. For this project, I will be focusing on the team-based fighting game Marvel vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes because it has a large roster and many button inputs that look intimadating. 

There are two pages. The first one is for the main team builder that keeps a basic list of characters at the top with just name, picture, and add button. Once add is hit, we send all character info into an empty array, then display the name, picture, inputs, and a delete button in case the user wishes to change a single character. 

Next, we have a home page that will show more universal commands such as the attack buttons and how to move, including a brief explanation of what the inputs commands will look like to make sure you understand them.
